"The groundwire-template-final step is run if this file is present in the profile."

This is part of a hack implemented in setuphandlers.py's importFinalTemplateSteps().

It checks to see if this text file is available in the profile before running the method.

The only time this would be available is initially when this extension profile is run to create
a site.  During other misc imports, it's not since it's not listed in import_steps.xml.
