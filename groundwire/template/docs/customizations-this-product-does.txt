==========
What customizations does this product do?
==========

Because this type of document is hard to maintain, we're sort of going to punt
on the answer to that question.  :)

This product does two basic types of customizations of Plone out of the box.
They are:
- skin level customizations
- site setup customizations

==========
SKIN LEVEL CUSTOMIZATIONS
==========
The former is easy to catalog; just look in skins/groundwire_template
to see what templates and scripts we're overriding (by and large, what you see
in there is a modified version of what Plone ships with; there are few completely
new items in there.)  In most cases, the differences are obvious; if not, run
diff against our version and CMFPlone's version (how's that for punting? :)

==========
SITE SETUP CUSTOMIZATIONS
==========
These are tweaks of the various settings scattered throughout the ZMI (some of
these settings are exposed now through the Plone administrative UI as well).
They are things we've found are required of more than 50% of our new sites 
(usually it's closer to 100%).  These are little things, like navigation 
settings, or the ability for anonymous viewers to see byline information.

To get a sense of what these things are, look at the docstrings for the unittests
we've created in the test suites in groundwire.template/tests/.  Look at any Python
script in that directory whose name starts with "test".  You don't need to know
Python to see what each test is testing for; we've written in plain English.

For instance, in testSetup, there is a test called "testPortletsAreFew" that 
looks like this:

def testPortletsAreFew(self):
    """We only want one portlet to start with: nav in the left col"""
    # left_slots should be: ('here/portlet_navigation/macros/portlet',)
    left_slots = ('here/portlet_navigation/macros/portlet',)
    self.failUnless(self.portal.left_slots==left_slots)

The part enclosed in """triple quotation marks""" is known as the "docstring"; it
explains what that particular bit of code does.  In this case, it tells us
that instead of the normal array of portlets in a new site, a Groundwire Template
site starts with only one.

For more information about unittests, see the README.txt inside the tests folder.
