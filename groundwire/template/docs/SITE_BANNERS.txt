Site Banners
============

Site banners replace our Plone 3 section banners with a simpler, more flexible
system for assigning banners. Site banners can be specified using any body
class that Plone assigns.

Adding Site Banners
-------------------

To add site banners, add a folder somewhere in the site hierarchy to hold the
banners. Then add images to the folder, matching the shortname of the image
to the desired body class. These are some of the body class patterns that 
Plone provides:

* section-[id]
* template-[template_id]
* portaltype-[portal_type]

The order of the CSS rules is determined by the order of images in the folder.
So, to make a particular rule override others, move it to the bottom of the
folder.

Adding the CSS
--------------

To add the CSS for the site banners, navigate to portal_css in the ZMI. Add a
new stylesheet with the following id, replacing /path/to/banner/folder with the
path to the folder that you created in the previous section:

path/to/banner/folder/site_banners.css

Then save your changes.

Adding the Banner Element
-------------------------

To place the banners, add the following markup to a page template or viewlet:

<div id="banner"></div>

If you need subsection banners, you'll need to wrap the banner element in
another element and output the subsection classes there:

<div tal:attributes="class context/@@site_banners.css/subsection_classes;">
    <div id="banner"></div>
</div>
