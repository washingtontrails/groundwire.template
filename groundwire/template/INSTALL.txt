To install this product, add groundwire.template to your buildout, re-run buildout,
and restart Zope. 

The typical use for this template is to use its setup profile when creating a 
Plone site.  If you use this method, it is important that the Groundwire Template
be the **only** extension profile selected when you install.

Alternatively you may, in any existing Plone instance, install groundwire.template
using the portal_quickinstaller in the ZMI or the "Add-ons" section
of the Plone administrative UI ("site setup").  Note that this method will not result
in many of the default site settings being applied -- it will mostly just give you
the skin-level improvements.
